## ActionCable basics

The initial commit was set up following DHH's tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0WUjGkDFS0&ab_channel=DavidHeinemeierHansson

After that, I loosely followed Greg Molnar's setup here:  https://github.com/gregmolnar/actioncable-examples/commit/7ae0fd0267a7d6033f5faac92e9ff4cb92fb9714

There were many small changes made to ActionCable's setup since that Devise integration was made. See commits for exact differences.
